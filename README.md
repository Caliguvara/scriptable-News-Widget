You can also add the Widget directly via the Scriptable Gallery: https://scriptable.app/gallery/news-widget

1. Enter "Wiggle Mode" on your homescreen and tap on the __+__ symbol
2. Search for and/or tap on Scriptable
3. Choose one of three sizes and tap __+ Add Widget__
4. Tap on the new widget while still in "Wiggle Mode" or long press on the widget and tap "Edit Widget"
5. Click on __Choose__ next to __Script__
6. Choose __News Widget__ from the list
7. Edit your parameters for the widget (see Widget Parameters below)
8. Tap anywhere outside of the config window and you're done! The widget should now load.

<a name="clear-cache"></a>
## News Widget Clear Cache.js

__News-Widget__ stores images and other data on your iPhone for faster loading and to save mobile data. You can't access those files directly. If there are problems or you want to delete all the cache files, just add __News-Widget-Clear-Cache.js__ to Scriptables and run the script in the app. It'll delete all cache files from News-Widget. Because the files are in a cache folder, iOS can delete thos files automatically, if there's not enough free space on your phone.

<a name="widget-update"></a>
# Update News Widget

To install or update News Widget hassle-free, please add __News Widget Update.js__ from this Repo to your Scriptable App and run the script in Scriptable. It'll save a backup of your existing News Widget Code and download the latest version of News Widget to your Scriptable App.

![update-example](https://github.com/Saudumm/scriptable-News-Widget/blob/main/images/update-example.jpg)

<a name="links"></a>
# Links

You can configure one or multiple Links to WordPress website and/or RSS feeds (at the same time!) directly in the script code (section STANDARD WIDGET CONFIG) or via a plain text file to use in widget parameters, if you want to set up different News Widgets.
The text file has to be plain text (no .doc, .rtf, etc...) and it has to be stored in the Scriptables folder in the Files App (iCloud Drive).

Every line has to contain a link to a WordPress website or RSS feed and the name of the site. Both values have to be separated by | (like widget parameters)
Links should start with either http:// or https://

In case you're not sure if a website is using WordPress, just add _/wp-json/wp/v2/posts_ at the end of the url (https://stadt-bremerhaven.de/wp-json/wp/v2/posts). If you see a lot of text in your browser, the site should work.
If not, you can search for an RSS feed (if the site has one) and use the link of the RSS feed (for example: )
